I think this is an incredible game because it is completely developed by a single person. However, its every aspect from music to art to machanics are all amazing. The game contains many elements that I enjoy, such as farming, fishing, fighting, etc. I played more than 400 hours on this game. I really hope one day I can develop a game as great as Stardew Valley.

I have heard this game before but never played it. It looks very interesting, I want to try it in my spare time.
